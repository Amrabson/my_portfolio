# Stroke Risk Analysis (Python, Jupyter Notebook)

A comprehensive data science project analyzing the factors contributing to stroke risk using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, statistical modeling, and interpretation of health data.

---

## Overview

The notebook investigates patterns and predictive factors associated with stroke occurrence.  
Using a real-world health dataset, we explore variable distributions, relationships, and build predictive models to identify significant risk factors.

---

## Key Steps

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Data cleaning, imputation, and encoding of relevant features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualization of key variables, distributions, and correlation analysis.

- **Model Development:**  
  Logistic regression and additional predictive models to estimate stroke risk.

- **Statistical Testing:**  
  Hypothesis testing and validation of significant predictors.

- **Interpretation:**  
  Discussion of model performance, feature importance, and clinical implications.

## Usage

1. **Open `StrokeAnalysis.ipynb`** in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/).
2. Ensure required packages are installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`).
3. Place the csv dataset into the same fodler you run the notebook
4. Run all cells to reproduce analysis, plots, and results.

## Example Outputs

- Histograms and boxplots of patient variables
- Correlation heatmaps
- Predictive model accuracy and coefficients
- Key insights into age, blood pressure, and other factors affecting stroke risk

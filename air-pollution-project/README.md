# Air Pollution Data Analysis (Python, Jupyter Notebook)

A comprehensive data science project exploring trends and risk factors in air pollution using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
Demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and insightful visualizations of air quality metrics.

---

## Overview

This notebook investigates historical air pollution data to understand spatial and temporal patterns, identify risk factors, and evaluate health and environmental impacts.  
The project leverages real-world datasets and modern data science techniques to derive actionable insights.

---

## Key Steps

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleans and structures raw air pollution data for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualizes key pollutants, locations, and time trends; computes summary statistics.

- **Statistical Modeling:**  
  Builds regression or classification models to predict pollution levels or risk.

- **Interpretation & Reporting:**  
  Summarizes findings, discusses policy/health implications, and visualizes results.

## Usage

1. **Open `AirPollution.ipynb`** in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/).
2. Make sure required Python packages are installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, etc).
3. Place the csv dataset in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Example Outputs

- Line and bar plots of pollutant concentrations over time
- Geographic maps or charts (if included)
- Model evaluation metrics (RMSE, accuracy, etc)
- Discussion of trends, anomalies, and public health implications

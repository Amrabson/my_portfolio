## Overview

This application provides accurate and up-to-date weather information by leveraging OpenWeatherMap’s One Call API.  
Users can search by city/state or zip code, select their preferred temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin), and receive detailed current weather metrics—all directly in the terminal.

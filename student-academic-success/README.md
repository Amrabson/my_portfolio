# Student Academic Success (Python, Jupyter Notebook)

A data science project exploring the factors affecting student academic performance, using real-world educational data and Python.  
Demonstrates full-cycle analysis: from data cleaning and visualization to predictive modeling and actionable insights.

---

## Overview

This notebook investigates student performance outcomes, examining which demographic, behavioral, and institutional variables contribute most to academic success. 
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and development of predictive models to identify at-risk students and optimize interventions.
In addition to the Jupyter Notebook analysis, a PowerPoint presentation summarizing key findings and recommendations is available upon request. Please contact the author for access.

## Key Steps

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleaning, transforming, and encoding raw academic and demographic data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  Visualizations and summary statistics to uncover patterns and relationships.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Creating meaningful variables from raw data to improve model accuracy.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Building and evaluating classification or regression models to predict student success.

- **Interpretation:**  
  Explaining model results and discussing implications for educational policy and support.

## Usage

1. **Open `StudentAcademicSuccessAnalysis.ipynb`** in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/).
2. Ensure the following Python packages are installed: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Place required dataset in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

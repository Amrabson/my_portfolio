# AI Influence on Employment

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence on global and sector-specific employment. Using datasets from OECD, Kaggle, and the World Economic Forum, it explores automation risk, emerging roles, and sectoral shifts in the labor market.

## Dataset and Features
- **OECD Employment Database**: Employment data by industry and job roles, across countries.
- **Kaggle AI Job Displacement Dataset**: Risk and likelihood of automation for various job roles.
- **WEF Future of Jobs Report**: Trends and forecasts for emerging and declining roles.

## Methods
- Data import, cleaning, and reshaping in R.
- Exploratory data analysis: time series, sectoral trends, cross-country comparisons.
- Linear regression for employment forecasting.
- Machine learning classification (planned for future work).

## Key Results
- The tech sector shows both resilience and high risk for automation in certain job roles.
- Administrative and clerical domains are among the most susceptible to AI-driven displacement.
- Recommendations highlight upskilling, ethical AI deployment, and longitudinal impact studies.
